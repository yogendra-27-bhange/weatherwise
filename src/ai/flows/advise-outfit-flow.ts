Based on the following weather conditions, provide a concise suggestion (around 15-25 words) for what to wear and a brief related activity tip.
Focus on practical advice. If it's raining, mention an umbrella. If it's very sunny and hot, mention sunscreen or staying hydrated.
If it's very cold, suggest warm layers.
